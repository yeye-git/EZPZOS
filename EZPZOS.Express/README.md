4. Markdown Preview Enhanced by `Yiyi Wang`
5. #region folding for VS Code by `maptz`
6. Todo Tree by `Gruntfuggly`

### Git Repository

Make sure the following Git Repository is cloned:

1. EZPZOS.Core is on the same level of this project
   ./EZPZOS.Express
   ./EZPZOS.Core
2. You need to run "npm run build" against EZPZOS.Core project  

## Getting Started

### Installing all the packges

Run:

```Powershell
npm i
```

### Database (MAC or if you prefer Docker)

1. Install Docker
2. In VS Code terminal or terminal, use bash
3. cd to ./docker
4. run chmod 755 ./Mac-Up.sh
5. run ./Mac-Up.sh -e dev
6. Wait for sometime until you see:
   <img src="./git readme img/Docker/Mac DB/Mac-Up.png"/>

7. Open Docker Window by double clicking on the icon in the task dock (for mac it's on the top right)

8. You can see your containers in the list
   <img src="./git readme img/Docker/Mac DB/Mac-Container.png"/>

Click on the triangle to expand and click on the `ezpzos-database-1` to go into the container

9. Search for log entries (and also for `Initialisation Complete`) shown in the screenshot
   <img src="./git readme img/Docker/Mac DB/Logs.png"/>
   Make sure there's no expceptions in between otherthan `Login failed` (this is docker health check)

10. For mac, click on `Exec` from the top bar:
    <img src="./git readme img/Docker/Mac DB/Exec.png"/>
    or for windows click on `CLI` to run cmd:
    <img src="./git readme img/Docker/Mac DB/CLI.png"/>
    for windows, you can skip this as windows has Visualised tool for database (<a href="#SSMS">SSMS</a>)

11. Run following cmd in the window:

```bash
bash
PATH=$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin/
sqlcmd -U sa -P EZPZOSAdmin!

```

<img src="./git readme img/Docker/Mac DB/Exec cmd.png"/>

12. You can now run queries in this window or if you wish you can use your own cli tools in Mac terminal. Just remember the port is `1433` for the docker database container.
    **Note: For anyone running sqlcmd, you will need to put a `go` like what shown in the last step for the query to run.**

13. To Update Database docker, run `Mac-Up.sh` again.
Updating SQL_SERVER_CREATE.sql and other queries won't update my database. 
You will need to delete the volume from the `Volumes` tab since the create script meant to initalise the database once not everytime when the docker is ran. If you don't want to lose data, you can either run init script manually or back up your data.
<img src="./git readme img/Docker/Mac DB/Delete Volume.png">

14. Troubleshoot:
<ul>
<li>Container won't run due to x86/arm64 issue, refer to Docker installation/configuration section</li>
<li>Exception from step 9. Try step 11 and see if you can run queries, you can init your database from this way (the hard way)</li>
</ul>

### Database Setup (Windows)

1. Install <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/sql-server/sql-server-downloads"> SQL Server </a>
   <img src="./git readme img/SQL Server Download.png"/>
   Once the intaller is download, run the installer.
   Choose `Basic(基本)` from the three options.
   Choose a install path and click on Install.

2. Intall <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16"> SQL Server management Studio </a>
   <img src="./git readme img/SSMS Download.png"/>
   Download and install.

### [Initiate Database](#SSMS)

1. Run SSMS.
   Click on connect button shown from the below screenshot:
   <img src="./git readme img/SSMS/SSMS 1.png"/>

2. On the popup window, make sure the server name is either `.` or `localhost`
   Make sure the Authentication is set to Windows Authentication.
   Click on `Connect`
   <img src="./git readme img/SSMS/SSMS 2.png"/>

3. If succeed, you will see connection from the left `Object Explorer`
   Click on `New Query` butto nfrom the below screenshot:
   <img src="./git readme img/SSMS/SSMS 3.png"/>

4. On the `query screen`, you can either `drag and drop` the `.sql` file from `./database/SQL_SERVER_CREATE.sql` to the query screen or `copy and paste` content from the file to the `query screen`
   <img src="./git readme img/SSMS/SSMS 4.png"/>

5. Click on the `Execute` button from the top or just simply press `F5` to run query.
   <img src="./git readme img/SSMS/SSMS 5.png"/>

6. You should be able to see the following message upon succeed:
   <img src="./git readme img/SSMS/SSMS 6.png"/>

7. You should be able to see the created database in the `Object Explorer`. (You might need to hit `Refersh` button to see)
   <img src="./git readme img/SSMS/SSMS 8.png"/>
   <img src="./git readme img/SSMS/SSMS 7.png"/>

8. From this point on, you can Run any query agasint Database `EZPZOS`.
   Just make sure when you are on the `query screen`, the selected database is `EZPZOS`:
   <img src="./git readme img/SSMS/SSMS 9.png"/>

### Running the Project

```Powershell
npm run start
```

### Debug

To run debugger you will need extenstion `TypeScript Debugger`

Find `Run & Debug` button on the vs code left panel or use key combination `Ctrl+Shift+D`.

On the new popuped panel, select `Server Debug` then click on the green triangle button to start debugging.

## Code Usage

### Logging

You should never use `console.log` function for logging in your commits.
Any PR that includes `console.log` will be rejected.
You might use `console.log` during your own testing.
To **Log** properly in this project, follow the below steps:

1. Make sure `EZPZOS.Core` is included and installed
2. Usage 1 Static logging:
   i. Import `LogHandler` from `EZPZOS.Core`

    ```Typescript
    import { LogHandler } from "ezpzos.core";
    ```

    ii. initiate inline and log

    ```Typescript
    new LogHandler({classname}).Log({functionName},{message},{LogLevel});
    ```

    e.g.

    ```Typescript
    new LogHandler('Main').Log('Run','This is a Test.', LogLevel.INFO);
    ```

    output:

    ```
    Main.Run [INFO]: This is a test.
    ```

3. Usage 2 Base inherite Class:
   for any class that has inherited Base class, simply call `this.Logger.Log()`

    e.g.

    ```Typescript
    this.Logger.Log('Run','This is a Test.', LogLevel.INFO);
    ```

### Dynamic Export
You will find in the `index.ts` file in project `EZPZOS.Core`, some of the exports are marked as Express Only. For those dynamic exports, you need to follow what's written in the `example/example.ts`.

To explain, these modules are exported dynamically during runtime.
Thus the exported module would be a `Promised import` object. You would need to either use chain function `then` to get the module or use `await` key word.

## Code Standards

### Rules

#### [Naming Convention](#naming-convention)

All variables or classnames except for packages or system defined cases should use Camel Case naming convention and should not contain spaces or underscore between words.
E.g.
CamelCaseWord

Invalid examples:

1. camelCaseWord
2. Camelcaseword
3. camel_case_word
4. ccw

Abbreviations should be avoided as much as possible. If abbreviations can't be avoided, consult admin is required before Pull Request.

#### Formatting Code

A `.prettierrc` file has been loaded to the project to make sure everyone will result in the same formatting. Thus, `Prettier` extensino is required to be installed. No one should use their own formatting settings.

#### File structure

TBD
